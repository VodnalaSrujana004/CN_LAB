# CN_LAB Manual designed by me
all experiments with outputs

List of Experiments
1. Implement the data link layer framing methods such as character, character-stuffing and bit
stuffing.
2. Write a program to compute CRC code for the polynomials CRC-12, CRC-16 and CRC CCIP
3. Develop a simple data link layer that performs the flow control using the sliding window
protocol, and loss recovery using the Go-Back-N mechanism.
4. Implement Dijsktraâ€™s algorithm to compute the shortest path through a network
5. Take an example subnet of hosts and obtain a broadcast tree for the subnet.
6. Implement distance vector routing algorithm for obtaining routing tables at each node.
7. Implement data encryption and data decryption
8. Write a program for congestion control using Leaky bucket algorithm.
